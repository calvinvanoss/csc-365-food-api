Project Description:\
We will create an API that provides recipes, nutritional information, or restaurant recommendations based on dietary restrictions or preferences. Recipes will consist of ingredients, where each ingredient contains its relevant dietary restrictions. Users can create their own recipes, and also give ratings to other recipes. Users will have their average recipe rating attached to their profile, along with their list of dietary restrictions or preferences.
